# Vest Spacemacs Layer
See the Quip [setup guide](https://vest.quip.com/TWIvAke8BABG/Spacemacs-Setup-Guide).

## Description
Default Spacemacs configs for `vest-hs` development. Included as part of the `vest-hs` repository because we're not sure if spacemacs supports loading layers from arbitrary GitHub repositories.
